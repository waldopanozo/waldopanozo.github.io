# Waldo M. Panozo – Personal CV Site

This repository hosts my personal CV site on GitHub Pages (`https://waldopanozo.github.io`). It showcases my professional profile, key achievements, skills, education, and selected projects in a modern, responsive layout.

## Highlights

- **Hero + detailed sections:** Up-to-date summary, achievements, experience timeline, skills, and education pulled directly from my resume.
- **Portfolio carousel:** Horizontal slider with smooth scrolling and custom controls for each featured project (React apps, APIs, etc.).
- **Blue-themed UI:** Translucent navigation bar, strong CTA buttons, and glassmorphism-inspired tiles.
- **Resume CTAs:** Download buttons in the hero, navbar, and contact area always point to the latest PDF.
- **Centralized contact:** Email, WhatsApp, availability, and social links presented as cards for quick access.

## Stack & Tooling

- HTML5 + Bootstrap
- Custom CSS (`assets/css/style-v2.css`)
- JavaScript/jQuery (`assets/js/custom-v2.js`) for smooth scrolling, animations, and carousel logic
- GitHub Pages for hosting
